Current prepared release: v0.6.43. This is a stability/audit step after the recovered v0.6.41 baseline and the cleanup release v0.6.42. The distribution no longer carries `router-agent/` baggage, the root UI route is now `Overview`, and the actual runtime contour is explicitly documented: Mihomo serves the UI and can redownload it after the UI directory is removed.

What is true right now
- runtime UI serving is tied to `mihomo.service` and the `/etc/mihomo/uiubuntu` directory;
- root `/ui/` should land on `Overview` first for a safer startup path;
- `Xui Hosts` and `Users` are UI sections already present in the app;
- no bundled standalone Ubuntu service is present in the distribution.

What is not claimed anymore
- no claim that a separate server-side service is already installed on the host;
- no claim that provider SSL checks and users inventory storage are already fully wired into the live backend contour.
